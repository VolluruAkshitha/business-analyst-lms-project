# Online Course Enrollment & Learning Management System (LMS) — BA Project

## Project Vision
This project shows end-to-end Business Analyst work for an Online Course Enrollment & Learning Management System (LMS).  
It includes requirements, BRD, user stories, process flows, UAT test cases, and sample SQL queries.

## Problem Statement
Currently, course enrollment is handled manually (emails/spreadsheets). This causes delays, duplicate records, and payment tracking issues.  
The proposed system will automate enrollment, course management, and payment tracking.

## Stakeholders

- Instructors
- Admin
- Finance Team
