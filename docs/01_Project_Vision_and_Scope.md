\# 01 - Project Vision and Scope



\## Project Name

Online Course Enrollment \& Learning Management System (LMS)



\## Vision (What we are building)

Build a web system where students can search courses, enroll, pay (if needed), and access course content.

Instructors can create courses and manage students.

Admins can manage users, approvals, and reports.

Current enrollment is handled manually using emails/spreadsheets.

This causes delays, duplicate records, missed payments, and poor tracking.
